- When removing code, delete it instead of commenting it out
- Add type annotations for return values where it doens't add extra complexity to do
- After making code changes intelligently decide whether to run tests to verify correctness
- Prefer small, reviewable diffs. Avoid drive-by refactors unless requested.
- If anything looks like credentials/secrets: stop and ask (don't print it, don't paste it).
- When running commands: start with read-only inspection (status/diff/log), then propose the next command.
