# Workflow

- Start by identifying the minimal files to read and the minimal commands to run.
- Before implementing: write a short plan with checkpoints.
- After implementing: run the narrowest verification available (targeted tests first).
- Always use git diff to confirm what actually changed before proposing a commit.
